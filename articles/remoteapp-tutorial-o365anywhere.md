Get the same O365 Experience on any device
===================


This article will cover how to deploy Office 365 on any device in your company. Your users can get the same capabilities and UI experience on Android, Apple and Windows. We will accomplish this using Azure RemoteApp by hosting Office 365 on scale-able Virtual Machines in Azure that users can connect to. This set of virtual machines we call a "Cloud Collection".

First after you have created an Azure Account, navigate to "RemoteApp" by clicking on the link on the left side.

Then continue by clicking new on the bottom and "quick creating" a collection. Provide a name, the region, the subscription, the plan and the image "Office Proffesional 2013" that we provide.
