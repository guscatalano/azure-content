What are the differences between Cloud and Hybrid Collections?
=====================================

This is a question we frequently get from our customers, this article hopes to answer and provide guidance for when Cloud is appropriate vs Hybrid.

When to choose Cloud 
-------------
A Cloud Collection is appropriate when the application will not require connectivity to any resources on your company's private network through a VPN device. If your application just uses resources on the Internet, OneDrive or Azure this will work for you and it's the simplest to setup.


When to choose Hybrid
-------------
Hybrid is more appropriate if you require connectivity back to your private network. Some good examples are: 

 - Private file servers
  - Quicken
   - Private databases
    - etc..

    This is generally more useful for large companies with lots of resources on their private networks that can't be moved to the Cloud.
